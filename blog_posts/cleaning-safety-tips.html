            <h2>Essential Cleaning Safety Tips for Your Home</h2>
            <p class="excerpt">Keeping your home clean is important for your health and well-being, but it's equally important to ensure you’re practicing safe cleaning habits. Many cleaning products contain chemicals that can be hazardous if not used correctly. Follow these essential safety tips to keep your home clean and your family safe.</p>
            
            <h3>1. Read Labels Carefully</h3>
            <p>Before using any cleaning product, always read the label. Cleaning agents often contain chemicals that require specific handling. Labels will provide important information about proper ventilation, safety gear to wear, and surfaces to avoid.</p>

            <h3>2. Ventilate the Area</h3>
            <p>Many cleaning products emit strong fumes, which can be harmful if inhaled. Always open windows and doors to ensure good airflow when using products with strong odors or chemicals.</p>

            <h3>3. Wear Protective Gear</h3>
            <p>It’s important to wear appropriate protective gear while cleaning. Depending on the products you use, this may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gloves: Prevent skin irritation from chemicals.</li>
                <li>Masks: Protect against inhaling harmful fumes or dust.</li>
                <li>Goggles: Protect your eyes from splashes, especially when using products like bleach.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Store Chemicals Safely</h3>
            <p>Keep cleaning products out of reach of children and pets. Many cleaning products can cause poisoning or severe burns if ingested or come into contact with skin. Store products in a high, locked cabinet to prevent accidental access.</p>

            <h3>5. Avoid Mixing Cleaning Products</h3>
            <p>Mixing certain cleaning products can create toxic gases that are harmful to your health. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bleach + Ammonia = Chloramine Gas (dangerous to inhale)</li>
                <li>Bleach + Vinegar = Chlorine Gas (very harmful to respiratory system)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Always use products as directed, and never experiment by mixing different chemicals.</p>

            <h3>6. List of Dangerous Chemicals to Handle with Caution</h3>
            <p>Certain chemicals in common household cleaners can be dangerous if not handled properly. Here are some that require extra caution:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bleach (Sodium Hypochlorite):</strong> Can irritate skin, eyes, and respiratory tract. Never mix with ammonia or acids like vinegar.</li>
                <li><strong>Ammonia:</strong> Causes skin and respiratory irritation. Highly dangerous when mixed with bleach.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydrogen Peroxide:</strong> Can irritate the skin and eyes in high concentrations.</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphoric Acid:</strong> Found in toilet bowl cleaners, it can cause severe burns.</li>
                <li><strong>Lye (Sodium Hydroxide):</strong> Used in oven and drain cleaners, it can cause burns and respiratory issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Quats (Quaternary Ammonium Compounds):</strong> Found in disinfecting wipes, can cause skin irritation and respiratory problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Formaldehyde:</strong> Known carcinogen, found in some cleaning agents. Use alternatives when possible.</li>
                <li><strong>2-Butoxyethanol:</strong> Common in window cleaners, can cause skin irritation and liver/kidney damage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>7. Practice Safe Ladder Use</h3>
            <p>When cleaning hard-to-reach places, use a stable step ladder or stool. Never use unstable furniture like chairs or tables to reach high places.</p>

            <h3>8. Protect Your Skin</h3>
            <p>Some cleaning products can irritate or damage your skin upon contact. Use gloves when working with products like bleach, oven cleaners, and degreasers to avoid burns and irritation.</p>

            <h3>9. Use Eco-Friendly Cleaning Products</h3>
            <p>Opt for natural cleaning products that use ingredients like vinegar, baking soda, and essential oils, which can often clean just as effectively without the dangers of harsh chemicals.</p>

            <h3>10. Keep Electrical Appliances Dry</h3>
            <p>Never clean electrical appliances, such as ovens or fridges, while they are plugged in. Disconnect appliances from power before cleaning to avoid electric shocks.</p>

            <h3>11. Dispose of Cleaning Products Properly</h3>
            <p>Many cleaning agents contain chemicals that are harmful to the environment. Follow local guidelines for hazardous waste disposal, and never pour leftover chemicals down the drain.</p>
